The project is focused on multiple linear regression problem and its aim is to predict a numerical response variable (the target feature). The report is divided into two phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2, each with its own assessment criteria.

Phase 1 (100 points) starts with giving a proper title to the project and creating a Table of Contents. The introduction section of Phase 1 includes the dataset source, dataset details, and dataset variables that will be used in the project. The response variable is also identified and it is important to make sure that it is a proper numerical variable. The goals and objectives for modeling the data are then outlined followed by data cleaning and preprocessing as necessary. Data exploration and visualization are also performed in this phase. The report concludes with a summary and conclusion of Phase 1.

Phase 2 (100 points) starts with creating a Table of Contents and giving an introduction to the report. This section includes a brief summary of the work conducted in Phase 1, an overview of the contents of the report, and an overview of the methodology used in the report. The main focus of Phase 2 is on statistical modeling where the methodology of multiple linear regression is used. This section includes building the full model, model evaluation, and interpretation of the results.

Overall, the project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, exploration, and visualization, followed by multiple linear regression modeling to predict the numerical response variable.
